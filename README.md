# Python Item Stock Checker
This project checks whether an item is in stock. If it is, it emails you. 
In the source code, you must change the variables to your information (email, password, recipient, etc.)

Note: The code might not work for all website. For instance, it doesn't work for Best Buy because they don't allow robots and scraping on their site.
Check the site's 'robots.txt' file to make sure you can (like 'gmail.com/robots.txt' or something)
